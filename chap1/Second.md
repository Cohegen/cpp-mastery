## Introduction to Variables
A variable is a named memory location that can be assigned to a value.
Also the value of a variable can be changed during the execution of a program.

Here we will be going through the components of `second.cpp`.

The `second.cpp` program introduces two new concepts.
First the statement:
```
int length; // this declares a variable

```
This statement declares a variable called length of type integer.
In C++ all variables must be declared before they are used.
And also the type of values that the variable can hold must also be specified in our case length only takes integer values.
Integers in C++ are whole number values whose range will be at least -32,768 through 32,767.

The second new feature is:
```
length = 7; // this assigns 7 to length
```
This assigns the value 7 to the length.
In C++ the assignment operator is the single equal sign.
It copies the values on the right side into the variable on its left.

The other statement is:
```
cout <<length; // this displays 7
```
This displays the value of a variable.
