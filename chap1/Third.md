##Introduction to Operator
Like many other programming languages C++ offers many types of operators.
These operators include:
1.Logical operators
2.Assignment operators
3.Arithmetic operators
4.Relational operators
5.Increment & decrement operators.
6.Bitwise Operators
7. Conditional Operators.
8.Special Operators.

In this section we will discuss the arithmetic operators.
They include: Addition,Subtraction,multiplication,division.

The `third.cpp` is a program that computes area of a rectangle by multiplying length by width.
The program delcares three variables length,width and areas.
It assigns the value 7 to lenngth and the value 5 to the width.
It then computes the product and assigns that values to area.
Then the program produces an output as follows:
```
The area is 35
```

Also instead of declaring variables line by line, it is also possible to declare two or more variables using the declaration statement.
We can declare them as follows:
```
int length,width,area; // all declared using one statement
```
